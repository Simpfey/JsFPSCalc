# JsFPSCalc
## Calculates Consoles FPS in JavaScript
Works Okay I suppose, Its just a simple FPS calculator that calculates fps in console,
but for some weird reason I saw that ! on my machine ! when I capped fps at 60 fps it capped at around 36-45 But It didn't reach 50-60, but when you cap above or cap at 65 it gives you 65 fps
